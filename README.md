# React Getting Started Using a JavaScript Generator

This idea came about when discussing use cases for JavaScript generators. The main logic can be viewed in `./src/App.js`.

# How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to serve the app on port 3000

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Thanks to [Nathan](https://twitter.com/nateplusplus) for the idea of using a generator for a simple Getting Started guide!
